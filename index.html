        <h3>Welcome to my server, a little information to get started</h3>
        <p>This is a small server of mine, most people have about a second of latency because my internet provider does not allow me to set up port forwardign. Do not be annoying, as that is annoying. Mainly have fun, the server is set to mostly standard settings, but does deviate in a couple spots</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The server is running Java edition, I have set up a bedrock connection, but be aware that Java edition will be running, not Bedrock</li>
            <li>The server shuts down at 3:00AM CST and starts booting up at 3:15AM CST</li>
            <li>I added a few mods mostly for compatability and one more that added waystones that allow you to telleport between them</li>
            <li>Only 1 person needs to sleep each night</li>
            <li>I added some mods for compatability, some other versions than what the server is running can connect, mostly staying above 1.21, but some others can connect, I am not sure what all but feel free to test</li>
            <li>Waystones have been implimented and there are a lot of them now, you can google sswaystones to find the recipe for them or ask me in game and I have a lot, additionally you can make portable waystones with a nether star, if you give me the nether star I can craft one at any time</li> 
            <li>You can spawn bots using the command (/player bot_name spawn) you can use simple commands to control them using the (/player bot_name) command and to get rid of them you can kill them manually or use (/player bot_name kill)</li>
            <li>I have recently been having fun with adding my own code to an existing mod that allows me to load code without restarting the server</li>
            <li>If you right click on the correct block types, they dissapear for a time and then reappear, but if you get out of render distance before they reappear, they will be gone forever. Most of the time this is set to all stained glass</li>
            <li>You can shoot fireballs like in bedwars and yes, they do destroy blocks, note that something is broken so you have to hit them after throwing them, im not sure why</li>
            <li>When you die, all your items stay on the block you died rather than scattering everywhere</li>
            <li>You can right click on crops to harvest and auto replant them</li>
            <li>Finally, for those lucky enough to visit the website, if you have a shulker box with vacuum in the name and keep it in your inventory or ender chest, if you put a partial stack of items in it, it will take items that you pick up to fill that stack. That might not be the best explanation, <a href="https://youtu.be/FMu8T8KriQY?si=Zrz5qzQV6wedaFc0&t=143">this</a> video has a better explanation of the vacuum feature, but I do not have the restock feature from that video</li>
            <li>If you cannot connect and you think it is something on my end, send me a text and I will get to it as soon as I can</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>People kept asking me</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Most bases used to be around -2350 80 -1630</li>
