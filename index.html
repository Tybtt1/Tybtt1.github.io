        <h3>Welcome to my server, a little information to get started</h3>
        <p>This is a small server of mine, if it's laggy, I'm sorry. That's probably because it's running on a several-decade-old motherboard and processor with 4 gigs of RAM. Do not be annoying, as that is annoying. Mainly have fun, the server is set to mostly standard settings, but does deviate in a couple spots</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Only 1 person needs to sleep each night</li>
            <li>The server is running Java edition, I have set up a bedrock connection, but be aware that Java edition will be running, not Bedrock</li>
            <li>The server shuts down at 3:00AM CST and starts booting up at 3:15AM CST
            <li>Last thing to note is that if a power outage happens at my house, the server will be down until I can sign back into the tunneling service. Port forwarding is annoying and I do not have the time to deal with it</li>
        </ul>
   
    </div>

    <footer>
        <h1>People keep asking me</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Most bases are around -2350 80 -1630</li>
